# Malaria QGFL Experiments - Complete Codebase Analysis

**Date:** October 3, 2025
**Purpose:** Systematic review before baseline experiments
**Status:** Foundation Ready for YOLO Baselines

---

## Executive Summary

### ✅ What's Working
- Complete YOLO training infrastructure (YOLOv8s, YOLOv11s)
- Comprehensive evaluation pipeline with 6 metric categories
- Strategy wrapper framework (NoWeights, WeightedBaseline, QGFL)
- W&B integration with detailed logging
- Dataset infrastructure (D1, D2, D3) in YOLO format

### ⚠️ What's Missing
- YAML configs for D2, D3 and other tasks (only d1_binary.yaml exists)
- RT-DETR implementation (planned for later)
- RedDino integration (Phase 3)
- Validation that WeightedBaseline and QGFL actually work as intended

### 🎯 Recommendation
**START WITH PURE BASELINES FIRST** - Run NoWeights strategy across all datasets/tasks before adding complexity

## 2. Training Infrastructure Analysis

### 2.1 Strategy Wrapper Deep Dive

#### NoWeightsStrategy (Lines 114-138)
```python
Purpose: True baseline - standard YOLO with no modifications
Implementation:
- class_weights = torch.ones()  # All classes weighted equally
- Loss params: cls=0.5, box=7.5, dfl=1.5  # YOLO defaults
- No hyperparameter adjustments
Status: ✅ WORKING (E1.1 completed successfully)
```

#### WeightedBaselineStrategy (Lines 141-170)
```python
Purpose: Standard practice - inverse frequency weighting
Implementation:
- Calculates class_weights via inverse frequency
- Scales cls loss by sqrt(weight_ratio)
- Caps cls weight at 2.0 to prevent instability
- Adjustments: patience=25, warmup_epochs=3

⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
This does NOT directly apply class weights to the loss!
It only scales the GLOBAL classification loss weight.

YOLO's loss structure:
total_loss = cls_weight * cls_loss + box_weight * box_loss + dfl_weight * dfl_loss

This strategy increases cls_weight for imbalanced datasets, but:
- Does NOT weight individual classes differently
- All predictions still treated equally within cls_loss
- May help slightly, but NOT true class weighting

Status: ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE VALUE - Not true inverse frequency weighting
```

#### QGFLStrategy (Lines 173-276)
```python
Purpose: Query-Guided Focal Loss with full parameter suite
Implementation:
- focal_alpha = 0.25
- focal_gamma = 2.0
- query_frequency = 0.3
- focus_weight = 2.0
- Calculates effective_weights combining class weights + focal alpha
- Returns modified loss weights: cls, box, dfl

⚠️ SAME ISSUE AS WeightedBaseline:
This also just modulates GLOBAL loss weights, not per-class weights!

The "effective_weights" are calculated but NEVER USED in actual training.
YOLO's native loss doesn't support per-class weighting directly.

Status: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY
- Calculations are correct but not connected to actual loss
- Would require custom YOLO loss function override
- Current implementation is essentially a more aggressive WeightedBaseline
```

### 2.2 How Training Actually Works (Notebook Cell Analysis)

```python
# Cell: Strategy Selection
TRAINING_STRATEGY = 'no_weights'  # ✅ This is what you ran

# Cell: Strategy Creation (Line 446)
strategy = create_training_strategy(TRAINING_STRATEGY, config, class_distribution)
strategy_params = strategy.get_training_params()  # Gets: cls, box, dfl weights

# Cell: Model Training (Line 587)
results = model.train(**train_args)

# What train_args contains:
train_args = {
    'data': yaml_path,
    'epochs': config.epochs,
    'batch': config.batch_size,
    'imgsz': config.imgsz,
    'device': config.device,
    'project': save_dir,
    'name': experiment_name,
    'exist_ok': True,
    **strategy_params,  # ← ONLY adds: cls=X, box=Y, dfl=Z
    **hyperparameter_adjustments  # ← Adds patience, warmup, etc.
}
```

**✅ CONCLUSION:** Your current setup ONLY modifies global loss component weights, NOT per-class behavior

## 3. Evaluation Pipeline Analysis

### 3.1 Comprehensive Evaluator (evaluator.py)

**✅ EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION** - This is publication-quality

#### Metrics Computed:
1. **Global Metrics** (compute_global_metrics, lines 87-104)
   - mAP@0.5, mAP@[0.5:0.95]
   - Mean precision, mean recall
   - Uses YOLO's native validation

2. **Per-Class Metrics** (compute_per_class_metrics, lines 106-210)
   - Precision, Recall, F1, Support
   - TP, FP, FN counts
   - Proper IoU matching (threshold 0.5)

3. **PR Curves** (compute_pr_curves, lines 212-347)
   - Full precision-recall curves
   - AP calculation via 11-point interpolation
   - Optimal threshold detection (max F1)
   - ✅ Stores complete curve data for plotting

4. **Prevalence-Stratified Analysis** (compute_stratified_analysis, lines 349-449)
   - ✅ CRITICAL FOR YOUR RESEARCH
   - Bins images by infection density: 0-1%, 1-3%, 3-5%, >5%
   - Calculates recall per bin
   - Addresses clinical relevance (low-prevalence performance)

5. **TIDE Error Analysis** (compute_error_analysis, lines 451-616)
   - Classification errors
   - Localization errors
   - Duplicate detections
   - Background false positives
   - Missed detections
   - ✅ Per-class AND aggregate statistics

6. **Confusion Matrix** (compute_confusion_matrix, lines 618-687)
   - Object-level confusion (not image-level)
   - Includes background/missed class

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND EXCELLENT - No changes needed

---

## 4. Critical Assessment: WeightedBaseline Value

### Question: Should we keep WeightedBaselineStrategy?

#### Arguments AGAINST:
1. **Not True Class Weighting**
   - Only scales global cls loss, doesn't weight classes differently
   - YOLO's loss doesn't natively support per-class weights
   - Name is misleading - sounds like inverse frequency weighting

2. **Minimal Expected Impact**
   - Changing cls from 0.5 to 1.5 affects ALL classes equally
   - Doesn't address class imbalance mechanism
   - Might help stability but not minority class recall

3. **Research Clarity**
   - Adds confusing middle step
   - Hard to interpret results (is improvement from higher cls weight or "weighting"?)
   - Not a standard baseline in literature

#### Arguments FOR:
1. **Standard Practice Comparison**
   - Shows "typical practitioner approach"
   - Some papers do scale classification loss for imbalance
   - Provides ablation point

2. **May Help Slightly**
   - Higher cls weight → model focuses more on classification
   - Could indirectly help minority class
   - Low risk to try

3. **Already Implemented**
   - Code exists and tested structure
   - Minimal time cost to run

### 📊 RECOMMENDATION:

**OPTION A: SKIP WeightedBaseline** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```
Baseline Experiments:
1. NoWeights (pure YOLO) → Establishes true baseline
2. QGFL (when properly implemented) → Tests your contribution

Benefits:
- Clearer story: baseline vs. your method
- Saves experiment time (~18 experiments → 12)
- Focuses on what matters
```

**OPTION B: KEEP as "Weighted Loss Baseline"**
```
Baseline Experiments:
1. NoWeights → Pure baseline
2. WeightedLoss → Standard practice (rename for clarity)
3. QGFL → Your contribution

Benefits:
- More thorough comparison
- Shows progression of techniques
- Addresses reviewer: "did you try standard approaches?"
```

**MY VOTE: Option A** - The "weighted" strategy isn't true class weighting and adds confusion

## 5. What's Missing: YAML Configs

### Current Status:
- ✅ `d1_binary.yaml` exists and works
- ❌ Missing 8 other configs

### Needed Configs:
```
configs/data_yamls/
├── d1_binary.yaml       ✅ EXISTS
├── d1_species.yaml      ❌ MISSING
├── d1_staging.yaml      ❌ MISSING
├── d2_binary.yaml       ❌ MISSING
├── d2_species.yaml      ❌ MISSING
├── d2_staging.yaml      ❌ MISSING
├── d3_binary.yaml       ❌ MISSING
└── d3_species.yaml      ❌ MISSING
```

### Template (from d1_binary.yaml):
```yaml
names:
  0: Uninfected
  1: Infected
nc: 2
path: /full/path/to/dataset_d1/yolo_format/binary
test: test/images
train: train/images
val: val/images
```

**Action Required:** Generate these 8 configs before running full experiment matrix

---

## 6. RT-DETR and RedDino Status

### RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformer)
**Status:** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Not in current codebase
- Would require different training approach than YOLO
- Different loss function interface
- Plan: Phase 1 Week 3 (after YOLO baselines)

### RedDino (Foundation Model)
**Status:** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Phase 3 enhancement
- Would integrate with RT-DETR
- Not needed for initial baselines

**Decision:** Correctly postponed - focus on YOLO first

---

## 7. Recommended Baseline Experiment Strategy

### Phase 1A: YOLO Baselines (NO advanced methods)
**Purpose:** Establish true baselines before any complexity

#### Experiments Matrix:
```
E1.1:  YOLOv8s  + D1 + Binary   + NoWeights  ✅ COMPLETE
E1.2:  YOLOv8s  + D2 + Binary   + NoWeights
E1.3:  YOLOv8s  + D3 + Binary   + NoWeights
E1.4:  YOLOv11s + D1 + Binary   + NoWeights
E1.5:  YOLOv11s + D2 + Binary   + NoWeights
E1.6:  YOLOv11s + D3 + Binary   + NoWeights
E1.7:  YOLOv8s  + D1 + Species  + NoWeights
E1.8:  YOLOv8s  + D1 + Staging  + NoWeights
E1.9:  YOLOv8s  + D2 + Staging  + NoWeights
E1.10: YOLOv8s  + D3 + Species  + NoWeights
```

**Total:** 10 experiments (vs. original 18 for Phase 1)
**Duration:** ~2-3 days for full training (200 epochs each)
**Duration:** ~6 hours for validation (10 epochs each)

### Phase 1B: Add Complexity (After baselines validated)
- RT-DETR baselines
- QGFL implementation (when properly implemented with custom loss)
- Advanced strategies

---

## 8. Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Create Missing YAML Configs
Generate 8 YAML files for all dataset/task combinations

### Step 2: Validation Run (TODAY)
```python
# Test one experiment from each dataset
Quick validation (10 epochs):
- E1.1: YOLOv8s + D1 + Binary  ✅ Already done
- E1.2: YOLOv8s + D2 + Binary  ← Run this
- E1.3: YOLOv8s + D3 + Binary  ← Run this

Purpose:
- Verify D2, D3 datasets load correctly
- Confirm evaluation pipeline works on all datasets
- Identify any issues before full training
```

### Step 3: Full Baseline Training (This Week)
```
Run all 10 baseline experiments (200 epochs)
Submit to cluster if available
Log everything to W&B
Aggregate results for analysis
```

### Step 4: Analysis & Decision (Next Week)
```
Analyze baseline results:
- Which datasets are hardest?
- How severe is class imbalance impact?
- Where is QGFL most needed?

Decide:
- Is WeightedBaseline worth implementing properly?
- Which QGFL configuration to try first?
- Move to RT-DETR or stay with YOLO?
```

## 9. Code Quality Assessment

### ✅ Strengths:
1. **Excellent evaluation pipeline** - Comprehensive, well-structured
2. **Good experiment organization** - Clear separation of concerns
3. **W&B integration** - Thorough logging and tracking
4. **Dataset management** - Clean YOLO format structure
5. **Notebook workflow** - Well-documented, reproducible

### ⚠️ Weaknesses:
1. **Strategy wrapper misleading** - Weighted/QGFL don't do what names suggest
2. **Missing YAML configs** - Only 1 of 9 exists
3. **No RT-DETR implementation** - Expected but understandable
4. **QGFL not truly implemented** - Would need custom loss function

### 🎯 Priority Fixes:
1. **HIGH:** Create 8 missing YAML configs (30 min)
2. **HIGH:** Document that "Weighted" strategy is NOT true class weighting
3. **MEDIUM:** Decide whether to fix QGFL or postpone
4. **LOW:** Add dataset validation scripts
